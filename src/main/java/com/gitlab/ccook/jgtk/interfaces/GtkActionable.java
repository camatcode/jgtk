     * for that action. Clicking on a particular button will activate the action with the target of that button,
     * which will typically cause the action's state to change to that value. Since the action's state is now equal to
     * the target value of the button, the button will now be rendered as active (and the other buttons, with different
     * targets, rendered inactive).
